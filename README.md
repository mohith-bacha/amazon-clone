# Amazon Clone

This project is a simplified clone of the Amazon homepage, built using HTML and CSS. It aims to replicate the design and layout of Amazon's main page, including the navigation bar, search bar, product categories, and a responsive layout.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar**: Contains the Amazon logo, search bar, location selection, account management, orders, and cart icon, built using Flexbox for responsive layout.
  
- **Panel Bar**: Includes quick access to different Amazon sections like miniTV, Best Sellers, Mobiles, Today's Deals, etc. The "Shop deals in Electronics" section is aligned to the right for user convenience.

- **Hero Section**: Displays a large promotional banner with a call-to-action message at the bottom, directing users to Amazon's regional site.

- **Shopping Categories**: A responsive grid layout showcasing different categories of products, including Clothes, Health & Personal Care, Electronics, Furniture, and more. Each box contains an image, category title, and a link to explore more items.

- **Footer Section**: Divided into four sections, the footer provides links to important areas like customer support, company info, careers, social media, and policies. It also includes a "Back to Top" button.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the page content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the layout, fonts, colors, and responsiveness.
  - Flexbox for arranging the elements within the navigation bar, search bar, and panel.
  - Custom hover effects on certain sections to improve user interactivity.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the webpage.
3. Modify the images or links in the HTML code to customize the content.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding JavaScript for interactive functionality (like a working search bar and dropdowns).
- Implementing real data-fetching from an API to display products dynamically.
- Enhancing responsiveness for different screen sizes.
